squids: Short Quasi-Unique Identifiers (â€˜SQUIDsâ€™)

The pkgdown website for this project is located at
<https://squids.opens.science>.

It is often useful to produce short, quasi-unique identifiers (â€˜SQUIDsâ€™)
without the benefit of a central authority to prevent duplication.
Although â€˜UUIDsâ€™ provide for this, these are also unwieldy; for example,
the most used â€˜UUIDâ€™, version 4, is 36 characters long. SQUIDs are short
at the expense of having more collisions. This can be mitigated by
combining them with human-produced suffixes, yielding relatively brief,
half human-readable, almost-unique identifiers. This package contains
functions to produce â€˜SQUIDsâ€™ as well as convert them back into dates
and times.
