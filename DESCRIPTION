Description: It is often useful to produce short, quasi-unique
    identifiers ('SQUIDs') without the benefit of a central authority to
    prevent duplication. Although 'UUIDs' provide for this, these
    are also unwieldy; for example, the most used 'UUID', version 4, is 36
    characters long. 'SQUIDs' are short (8 characters) at the expense of having 
    more collisions. This can be mitigated by combining them with human-produced
    suffixes, yielding relatively brief, half human-readable, almost-unique
    identifiers. This package contains functions to produce 'SQUIDs' as well as 
    convert them back into dates and times.
